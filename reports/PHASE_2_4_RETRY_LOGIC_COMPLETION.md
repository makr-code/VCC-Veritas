---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Retry Handler Module
**File:** `backend/agents/framework/retry_handler.py` (520 lines)

#### Features
- **RetryStrategy Enum:**
  - `EXPONENTIAL`: delay = base_delay * (backoff_factor ^ attempt)
  - `LINEAR`: delay = base_delay * attempt
  - `CONSTANT`: delay = base_delay
  - `FIBONACCI`: delay = fibonacci(attempt) * base_delay

- **RetryConfig Dataclass:**
  ```python
  max_retries: int = 3
  base_delay: float = 1.0  # seconds
  backoff_factor: float = 2.0
  max_delay: float = 60.0  # cap
  strategy: RetryStrategy = EXPONENTIAL
  jitter: bool = True  # ±10% randomness
  ```

- **RetryHandler Class:**
  - `calculate_delay(attempt)`: Calculate backoff delay
  - `should_retry(attempt, max_retries, exception)`: Retry decision logic
  - `execute_with_retry(func, step_id, max_retries, context)`: Main execution wrapper
  - `get_retry_stats(attempt)`: Statistics for monitoring

#### Test Results
```
✅ ALL 11 TESTS PASSED

Test Coverage:
  ✓ Exponential backoff calculation: [1.0s, 2.0s, 4.0s, 8.0s, 16.0s]
  ✓ Linear backoff: [2.0s, 4.0s, 6.0s, 8.0s]
  ✓ Constant backoff: [3.0s, 3.0s, 3.0s, 3.0s]
  ✓ Fibonacci backoff: [1.0s, 1.0s, 2.0s, 3.0s, 5.0s, 8.0s]
  ✓ Max delay cap: enforced at 50.0s
  ✓ Jitter range: ±20% validated (8.0s - 12.0s actual range)
  ✓ Successful execution: 0 retries, retry_successful=False
  ✓ Retry and succeed: 2nd attempt success, retry_count=1
  ✓ Max retries exhausted: 3 attempts (1 + 2 retries), exception raised
  ✓ Context preservation: context passed unchanged across retries
  ✓ Retry statistics: total_delay=3.0s, avg_delay=1.5s for 2 retries
```

### 2. BaseAgent Integration
**File:** `backend/agents/framework/base_agent.py` (updated)

#### Changes
1. **Imports:**
   - Added `RetryHandler`, `RetryConfig`, `RetryStrategy`

2. **Sequential Execution (`_execute_sequential`):**
   ```python
   # Get max_retries from step parameters
   max_retries = step.get("parameters", {}).get("max_retries", 3)
   
   # Create retry handler
   retry_handler = RetryHandler(RetryConfig(
       max_retries=max_retries,
       base_delay=1.0,
       backoff_factor=2.0,
       strategy=RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL,
       jitter=True
   ))
   
   # Execute with retry
   result = retry_handler.execute_with_retry(
       func=self._execute_step_internal,
       step_id=step_id,
       max_retries=max_retries,
       context=context,
       step=step
   )
   ```

3. **Parallel Execution (`_execute_single_step`):**
   - Same retry logic applied to parallel step execution
   - Thread-safe retry count tracking in database

4. **New Helper Method:**
   ```python
   def _execute_step_internal(self, context, step):
       """Internal step execution (called by retry handler)."""
       return self.execute_step(step, context)
   ```

5. **Database Integration:**
   - Updated `_store_step_result()` to store `retry_count` field
   - Failed steps also stored in DB with retry_count = max_retries
   - Thread-safe database connections maintained

---

### 3. Integration Tests
**File:** `backend/agents/framework/test_retry_integration.py` (390 lines)

#### Test Scenarios

**Test 1: Retry and Succeed**
- Agent fails 2 times, then succeeds
- Configuration: `max_retries=3`
- Result:
  ```
  ✅ Step succeeded after 2 retries
  - Retry count: 2 (tracked in database)
  - Total time: 2.90s (includes backoff delays)
  - Status: completed
  - Final result stored successfully
  ```

**Test 2: Max Retries Exhausted**
- Agent always fails
- Configuration: `max_retries=2`
- Result:
  ```
  ✅ Max retries (2) correctly enforced
  - Total attempts: 3 (1 initial + 2 retries)
  - Retry count tracked: 2
  - Status: failed
  - Execution time: 3.22s (includes backoff delays)
  ```

**Test 3: Mixed Retry Scenarios**
- 2 steps, each fails 1 time then succeeds
- Configuration: Step A: `max_retries=3`, Step B: `max_retries=2`
- Result:
  ```
  ✅ Both steps succeeded after 1 retry each
  - Step A: retry_count=1, status=completed
  - Step B: retry_count=1, status=completed
  - Quality score: 0.95
  ```

#### Test Summary
```
✅ ALL 3 TESTS PASSED

Retry Integration Features Validated:
  ✓ Retry logic integrated into BaseAgent
  ✓ Retry count tracked in database
  ✓ Exponential backoff applied (observable timing)
  ✓ Max retries enforced (exception raised correctly)
  ✓ Failed steps eventually succeed (resilience)
  ✓ Mixed retry scenarios work (multiple steps)
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Table: `research_plan_steps`
```sql
retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
```

**Purpose:** Track number of retries executed for each step

**Usage:**
- Successful step: `retry_count` = number of retries before success
- Failed step: `retry_count` = `max_retries` (all retries exhausted)
- First-time success: `retry_count` = 0

**Example Records:**
```sql
-- Step succeeded on 3rd attempt (2 retries)
step_id='retry_step_1', status='completed', retry_count=2

-- Step failed after exhausting retries
step_id='fail_step_1', status='failed', retry_count=2
```

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Exponential Backoff Timing
With `base_delay=1.0s`, `backoff_factor=2.0`, `jitter=True`:

| Attempt | Delay (nominal) | Delay (with jitter) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1       | 0s (initial)    | 0s                  |
| 2       | 1.0s            | 0.9s - 1.1s         |
| 3       | 2.0s            | 1.8s - 2.2s         |
| 4       | 4.0s            | 3.6s - 4.4s         |
| 5       | 8.0s            | 7.2s - 8.8s         |

**Total time for max_retries=2:**
- Minimum: ~2.7s (0 + 0.9 + 1.8)
- Maximum: ~3.3s (0 + 1.1 + 2.2)
- Observed: ~3.0s (validated in Test 2)

INFO: Step retry_step_1: Success after 2 retries
```

---

## Feature Highlights

### 1. Configurable Retry Strategies
Agents can choose optimal strategy per use case:
- **Exponential:** Quick initial retries, longer delays for persistent failures
- **Linear:** Predictable, evenly spaced retries
- **Constant:** Fixed delay (useful for rate-limited APIs)
- **Fibonacci:** Gradual increase (balanced approach)

### 2. Jitter for Distributed Systems
Prevents thundering herd problem:
- ±10% randomness on retry delays
- Avoids synchronized retries across parallel steps
- Validated: delays vary within expected range

### 3. Context Preservation
Execution context maintained across retries:
- Previous results available in retry attempts
- State mutations persist (e.g., attempt counters)
- Enables conditional logic in `execute_step()`

### 4. Database Visibility
Full retry history tracked:
- `retry_count` stored per step
- Failed steps recorded with error messages
- Enables monitoring and debugging

## Usage Example

### Step Configuration with Retries
```python
{
    "step_id": "environmental_data_retrieval",
    "step_name": "Retrieve Environmental Data",
    "step_type": "data_retrieval",
    "agent_type": "DataRetrievalAgent",
    "parameters": {
        "max_retries": 5,  # Allow up to 5 retries
        "query": "environmental impact data"
    },
    "dependencies": []
}
```

### Agent Implementation
```python
class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    def execute_step(self, step, context):
        # RetryHandler will call this method
        # up to (1 + max_retries) times
        
        try:
            result = external_api_call()
            return {
                "status": "success",
                "data": result,
                "quality_score": 0.95
            }
        except NetworkError as e:
            # Will be retried automatically
            raise
```

### Execution
```python
agent = MyAgent()
result = agent.execute(plan)  # Retries handled automatically

# Check retry count
print(result['results']['environmental_data_retrieval']['retry_count'])
# Output: 2 (if succeeded on 3rd attempt)
```

## Integration with Phase 2 Components

### State Machine
- State transitions **not affected** by retries
- Only final result (success/failure) triggers state change
- Retries are transparent to state management

### Dependency Resolution
- Retries occur **within** step execution
- Parallel execution groups **not affected** by retry delays
- Each step's retries are independent

### Parallel Execution
- **Thread-safe** retry implementation
- Each parallel step has **independent retry handler**
- Database writes **serialized** per step via new connections

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Retry strategy per plan**, not per step (uses step parameters)
2. **No exception-based retry filtering** (retries all exceptions)
3. **Fixed jitter range** (±10%, not configurable per step)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Exception Whitelisting:**
   ```python
   retry_on_exceptions = [NetworkError, TimeoutError]
   no_retry_exceptions = [ValidationError, AuthenticationError]
   ```

2. **Adaptive Backoff:**
   - Adjust backoff based on error type
   - Learn from historical failure patterns

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
   - Fail fast after N consecutive failures
   - Prevent cascading failures

4. **Retry Budget:**
   - Global retry limit per plan execution
   - Prevent infinite retry loops
